Classifying the sky’s color is one way to indicate the level of aerosol loading in the atmosphere. Citizen scientist can help in this effort by recording the color consistently so it can be used for analysis. Create a tool that lets people record the color of the sky using consistent and qualitative standards at a specific location. The tool can compare results to the nearest data from Aeronet (AErosol RObotic NETwork) or similar sources, which could be used to improve the accuracy of these networks.

Background

Sky color is a way to provide a qualitative indication of aerosol loading in the atmosphere. It is an accessible way for students and others to observe the environment, but the observations could benefit from a more quantitative way to record the information. People can gather sky color data in a consistent manner (there is at least one sky color and visibility protocol) and compare it to the level of aerosols from air quality monitors.

Solution Ideas

Here are some ways for you to frame this solution:

Develop a method to use a smartphone camera to quantitatively assess sky color using sky color protocols; pull in the nearest Aeronet (or similar) data; present the sky color and Aeronet information together for further analysis; and allow users to compare the data from a single location in different times and locations.
